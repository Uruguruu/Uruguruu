  Hi there!
  My Name is Samuel.
</h1>

### Background

* My fascination with technology began at a young age, heavily influenced by my father's work as an application developer. This early exposure solidified my ambition to pursue a career in the field. 💻
* My passion for gaming further deepened this connection, sparking a keen interest in software architecture and user experience. 🎮
* I began my practical journey in secondary school by managing websites for family and friends. 🌐
* This responsibility soon evolved into developing websites for small businesses, allowing me to continuously advance my skills through hands-on, real-world projects over the years. 📈
* During my apprenticeship, I built on this foundation, accelerating my learning across a variety of modern web technologies (like Next.js and NiceGUI) and diving deep into the SAP ecosystem (ABAP, Fiori, SAPUI5). 🚀
